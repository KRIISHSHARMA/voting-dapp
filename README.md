- If you are getting `nothing to compile error` try the following:
  - clearing cache ` npx hardhat clean`
  - try deleting cache and artifacts folder `rm -rf cache artifacts`
  - try forcing recompilation `npx hardhat compile --force`
  - Make sure that the solidity version in hardhat.config.js is the same as in Token.sol or any solidity file you create
  - Move your Sol file to a contract folder

# Connecting Metamask with a Local Hardhat Network [reference](https://medium.com/@kaishinaw/connecting-metamask-with-a-local-hardhat-network-7d8cea604dc6)

- run node in root folder (keep it running)
``` sh
npx hardhat node
```

- Running the above command, you will get the RPC endpoint as well as a list of locally generated accounts. We will need the endpoint as well as the private keys for configuring Metamask.

## Add Local Network to Metamask

- Select the ‚ÄúAdd Network‚Äù button and you will be greeted with a form requesting for the relevant network details. In order to connect to our local network, we will be using the following:
- Network Name: Hardhat‚Äî This is up to you and defines how the network will show up in your network dropdown.
- New RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/ ‚Äî The endpoint returned from running npx hardhat node earlier.
- Chain ID: 31337 ‚Äî This is the default chain identifier that is implemented by Hardhat. You can refer to their documentation here.
- Currency Symbol: HardhatETH ‚Äî This is up to you and defines the symbol for the local network currency (ie. ETH).

## Importing Test Accounts

- In order to add these accounts to Metamask, we will need to add the private keys which were returned when we ran the npx hardhat node command.

- Select the ‚ÄúImport Account‚Äù option and Metamask will prompt you for the private key string. Paste the private keys from earlier, it should look something like this:

` 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`
